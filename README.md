# scHetG

![overview](/overview.png "overview")

Given that existing methods disregard the structural information between cells and genes, we proposed a structure-preserved scRNA-seq data integration approach using heterogeneous graph neural network (scHetG). By establishing a heterogeneous graph that represents the interactions between multiple batches of cells and genes, and combining a heterogeneous graph neural network with contrastive learning, scHetG concurrently obtained cell and gene embeddings with structural information.

## demo

scHetG is implemented in Python 3.9, the code execution adheres to the subsequent steps:
